# HLP Group Meetings

## Meeting 1: 15/02/20

#### Role assignments:
* Symbol module: Spyros and Jacob

* Sheet module: Iason and Sara

#### For next meeting:
* Everyone clone the skeleton code repository, and run the project skeleton code in preparation for the meeting with the group supervisor on 16/02/20.


#### Interfacing functions between modules
Since the compile order is Symbol -> BusWire -> Sheet, BusWire can call interfacing functions inside of the Symbol module, and Sheet can call interfacing functions inside of the BusWire and Symbol modules.
